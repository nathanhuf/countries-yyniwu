# 🗺️ OctoML Countries Take-Home

## 🔎 Overview

In this exercise, you will be creating a small web application that integrates with the free [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) where you can browse and view details for any country.

## 📋 Requirements

### 🕹️ Functionality

Your web application should be able to do the following:

- Homepage
  - Show all countries available from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/). Clicking on any country should navigate to that country's details page.
  - Search by country name.
  - Filter by country region (single-value select).
- Details page
  - Display the country name, flag, and some details.
  - List the bordering countries as clickable button links that navigate to their own details pages.
  - Include a back button that navigates back to the homepage.

### 🎨 Design

The Figma mocks are available at [OctoML | Countries Take-Home](https://www.figma.com/file/XxkVWmYo4iPwi1VNOoHdY1/OctoML-%7C-Countries-Take-Home?type=design&mode=design&t=xMetCIfqDzJqxGwQ-1). If you don't have access to the file, please reach out to your recruiter so we can grant the correct permissions. Any details about fonts, colors, etc. are included in a notes section on that page.

### 🛠️ Implementation

You are able to choose a tech stack that you feel the most comfortable with as long as your solution is built using React and TypeScript.

- Styling
  - We recommend avoiding any pre-styled components libraries such as [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), or [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/). Unstyled primitives libraries such as [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), and [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) are perfectly fine though. We're more interested in testing your CSS skills than whether you know how to create a dropdown select component from scratch 😂.
- Icons
  - Don't worry too much about perfectly matching the icons to the Figma mocks. You can use the closest icons from libraries like [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) or [Tabler Icons](https://tabler-icons.io/).
- Testing is **NOT** a requirement for this exercise.

### Submitting

When you're done, please push your changes and submit the assignment on CodeSubmit.

### Feedback / Questions

If you have any feedback or questions about the take-home exericse, please feel free to reach out to your recruiter and they can forward your message to the correct people.
